Update the mobile navigation bar to match a luxury fashion / ethnic wear website style.

Requirements:

Mobile-first slide-in navigation drawer (opens from right)

Light ivory / cream background 


Top-right: close (X) icon

Vertical list of navigation links with generous spacing:

Home

Shop

About

Contact

Typography & Style:

Elegant serif or modern luxury font

Medium font weight

Dark brown / maroon text color

Clean, minimal, breathable layout

Thin divider lines between items (very subtle)

Interaction:

Smooth slide-in / slide-out animation

Close drawer when a menu item is clicked

Overlay background dimmed when menu is open

Do NOT change desktop navigation

Apply changes only for mobile view

Reuse existing links and routes

Overall feel should be premium, calm, fashion-boutique inspired, similar to high-end Indian wear brands.

Only modify mobile navigation styles and behavior. Do not refactor layout or routing logic.
